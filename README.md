## A simple tutorial on recurrent network in Python

It has a single-sample-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The recurrent network supports both external recurrence and internal recurrence. 
 - The external recurrence happens when forwarding more than one sample consecutively before back-propagation and parameters update. The times of external recurrence are decided by the input data.
 - The internal recurrence happens within a sample's forwarding, which can be considered as external recurrence but reusing a same sample. The times of internal recurrence are specified in argument. 

An example for MNIST is given, with >97% accuracy. The MNIST case uses RNN in a way that, it splits one digit image data into equal-length pieces, and feeds the pieces into the network one by one recurrently, then outputs the recognization result with a softmax layer. 

Another example for sequence prediction is given too. This example uses a sequence of 30 consecutive sine values (real numbers) to predict the next sine value. The 30 samples are generated by sine function of 30 evenly spaced numbers between i and i+5, where i is a random number.
